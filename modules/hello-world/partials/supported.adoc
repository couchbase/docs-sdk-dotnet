The Couchbase .NET SDK is compatible with https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard[.NET Standard] 2.0 and .NET Standard 2.1, via the currently supported Microsoft .NET SDKs.
Currently, that includes https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core[.NET 6.0 and later] for .NET Standard 2.1 and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-framework[.NET Framework 4.6.2 and later] for .NET Standard 2.0.
The https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard[.NET Standard documentation] and
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/dotnet-standard#versions[.NET Standard version chart] may be useful to help understand other available options.

Couchbase strongly recommends using the latest LTS version of .NET that's officially supported by both Microsoft and Couchbase.
Other .NET implementations may work, but aren't tested, and are outside the scope of technical support.
