The Couchbase .NET SDK is compatible with https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard[.NET Standard] 2.0 and .NET Standard 2.1, which means that it's compatible with .NET Framework 4.6.2+, .NET 5.0, .NET 6.0, and .NET Core 3.1.
The https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard[.NET Standard documentation] and
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/dotnet-standard#versions[.NET Standard version chart] may be useful to help understand other available options.

Couchbase strongly recommends using the latest version of .NET that's officially supported by both Microsoft and Couchbase.
Other .NET implementations may work, but aren't tested, and are outside the scope of technical support.
