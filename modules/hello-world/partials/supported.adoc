The Couchbase .NET SDK targets and is tested with https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard[.NET Standard] 2.0 and 2.1, which in turn supports .NET Framework 4.6.2+ and .NET Core (e.g. netcoreapp) 2.1. A full list of supported platforms can be found in the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support[.NET Standard documentation]. The SDK also may use some dependencies that have not yet made it into .NET Standard; these can enabled by targeting .netcoreapp2.1 or .netcoreapp3.0. Eventually as they are added to the standard, these platform targets will be removed.
