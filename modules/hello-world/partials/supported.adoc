The Couchbase .NET SDK is compatible with https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard[.NET Standard] 2.0 and .NET Standard 2.1, via the currently supported Microsoft .NET SDKs.
Currently, that includes https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core[.NET 6.0 and later] for .NET Standard 2.1 and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-framework[.NET Framework 4.6.2 and later] for .NET Standard 2.0.
The https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard[.NET Standard documentation] and
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/dotnet-standard#versions[.NET Standard version chart] may be useful to help understand other available options.

Couchbase strongly recommends using the https://versionsof.net/[latest LTS version of .NET that's officially supported] by both Microsoft and Couchbase.
Other .NET implementations may work, but aren't tested, and are outside the scope of technical support.
