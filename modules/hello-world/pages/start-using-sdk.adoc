[abstract]
The Couchbase .NET SDK enables you to interact with a Couchbase Server cluster from .NET using C# and other .NET languages.
It offers an asynchronous API based on the _Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)_.

The Couchbase .NET client allows applications to connect to Couchbase Server using any Common Language Runtime (CLR) language, including C#, F#, and VB.NET. 
The SDK is written in C#, and some of its idiomatic patterns reflect that choice.

== Installing the SDK

The Couchbase .NET SDK targets https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard[.NET Standard 2.0], which in turn supports .NET Framework 4.6.2+ and .NET Core (e.g. netcoreapp) 2.1. 
The library is distributed in a number of ways:

|===
|NuGet |NuGet package host at https://www.nuget.org/packages/CouchbaseNetClient/[nuget.org] (_recommended_)
|Zip |Zip file with can be downloaded https://packages.couchbase.com/clients/net/3.0/Couchbase-Net-Client.3.0.0-beta2.zip[here]
|Build from Source |Build the library from https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/[source available on GitHub] (not officially supported)
|===


== Hello Couchbase

Start a new console project (in Visual Studio or VS Code, etc). 
Install the latest 3.0 CouchbaseNetClient NuGet package.

The following code samples assume:

* Couchbase Server is installed and accessible locally (xref:server:getting-started:do-a-quick-install[Do a Quick Install] if you don't already have Couchbase Server installed).
* You have create a bucket (perhaps using the xref:server:manage:manage-settings:install-sample-buckets[travel-sample dataset], or by creating a new bucket).
* You have created a Couchbase user named "username" with permissions to access the cluster (at least Application Access permissions).

Firstly, you will need to have a few `using` statements at the top of *Program.cs* in your console program:
[source,csharp]
----
include::example$StartUsing.cs[tag=using,indent=0]
----

Then you can connect to the cluster:

[source,csharp]
----
include::example$StartUsing.cs[tag=connect,indent=0]
----

Couchbase uses xref:server:learn:security/roles.adoc[Role Based Access Control (RBAC)] to control access to resources.
If you're developing client code on the same machine as the Couchbase Server, your URI can be _couchbase://localhost_.

Then open the bucket:
[source,csharp]
----
include::example$StartUsing.cs[tag=bucket,indent=0]
----

Substitute whatever bucket name you want for _bucket-name_ in the above example.

The 3.0 SDK is ready for the introduction of xref:concept-docs:collections.adoc[Collections] in an upcoming release of the Couchbase Data Platform.
The latest release, Couchbase Server 6.5, brings a limited _Developer Preview_ of Collections, allowing Documents to be grouped by purpose or theme, according to specified _Scope_.
Here we will use the `DefaultCollection`, which covers the whole Bucket and _must be used when connecting to a 6.5 cluster or earlier_.

[source,csharp]
----
include::example$StartUsing.cs[tag=collection,indent=0]
----

To get you started the following code creates a new document and then fetches it again, printing the result.

[source,csharp]
----
include::example$StartUsing.cs[tag=upsert-get,indent=0]
----

[NOTE]
====
Other possible key/value CRUD Operations are described in detail on the xref:howtos:kv-operations.adoc[KV Operations page].
====

You can also perform a N1QL query with the cluster object:

[source,csharp]
----
include::example$StartUsing.cs[tag=n1ql-query,indent=0]
----

You can learn more about N1QL queries on the xref:howtos:n1ql-queries-with-sdk.adoc[Query page].

== Full Example

If you want to copy and paste to run the full example, here it is:

[source,csharp]
----
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Couchbase;

namespace examples
{
    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            var cluster = await Cluster.ConnectAsync("couchbase://localhost", "username", "password");
            var bucket = await cluster.BucketAsync("bucket-name");
            var collection = bucket.DefaultCollection();

            var upsertResult = await collection.UpsertAsync("my-document-key", new { Name = "Ted", Age = 31 });
            var getResult = await collection.GetAsync("my-document-key");
            Console.WriteLine(getResult.ContentAs<dynamic>());

            var queryResult = await cluster.QueryAsync<dynamic>("select \"Hello World\" as greeting", new Couchbase.Query.QueryOptions());
            await foreach (var row in queryResult) {
                Console.WriteLine(row);
            }
        }
    }
}
