= Install and Start Using the .NET SDK with Couchbase Server
:navtitle: Start Using the SDK

[abstract]
The Couchbase .NET SDK enables you to interact with a Couchbase Server cluster from the .NET Framework using C# and other .NET languages.
It offers both a traditional synchronous API and an asynchronous API based on the _Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)_.

include::partial$beta-warning.adoc[]

The Couchbase .NET client allows applications to connect to the Couchbase Data Platform using any Common Language Runtime (CLR) language, including C#, F#, and VB.NET.
The SDK is written in C#, and some of its idiomatic patterns reflect that choice.
The .NET SDK 3.0 is a complete rewrite of the API, reducing the number of overloads to present a simplified surface area, and adding support for future Couchbase Server features like Collections and Scopes (available in Couchbase Server 6.5 as a xref:concept-docs:collections.adoc[developer preview]).
The API is now fully async.


== Installing the SDK

The Couchbase .NET SDK targets https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard[.NET Standard 2.0], which in turn supports .NET Framework 4.6.2+ and .NET Core (eg netcoreapp) 2.1. The library is distributed in a number of ways:

|===
|Nuget |Nuget package host at https://www.nuget.org/packages/CouchbaseNetClient/[nuget.org] (_recommended_)
|Zip |Zip file with can be downloaded https://packages.couchbase.com/clients/net/3.0/Couchbase-Net-Client.3.0.0-beta2.zip[here]
|Build from Source |Build the library from source https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-net-client/[here] (not officially supported)
|===

In VS Code, with the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jmrog.vscode-nuget-package-manager[NuGet Package Manager Extension], open the command palette and type "nuget", then "CouchbaseNetClient", and select the latest 3.0 version available.

== Hello Couchbase

Now you have the .NET client installed, open a fresh project in _VS Code_, and try out the following, which assumes a user named "user" with permissions to access the cluster, typically the "Application Access" role:

[source,csharp]
----
using Couchbase;
â€¦
var cluster = Cluster.Connect("couchbase://localhost", "user", "pass");
----

Couchbase uses xref:6.0@server:learn:security/roles.adoc[Role Based Access Control (RBAC)] to control access to resources.
If you're developing client code on the same VM or machine as the Couchbase Server, your URI can be _couchbase://localhost_.

[source,csharp]
----
var bucket = await cluster.BucketAsync("bucket-name");
----

If you installed the travel sample data bucket, substitute _travel-sample_ for _bucket-name_.

[source,csharp]
----
var collection = bucket.DefaultCollection();
----

The 3.0 SDK is ready for the introduction of xref:concept-docs:collections.adoc[Collections] in Cheshire Cat, the next release of the Couchbase Data Platform.
The latest release, Mad Hatter, brings a limited _Developer Preview_ of Collections, allowing Documents to be grouped by purpose or theme, according to specified _Scope_.
Here we will use the `DefaultCollection`, which covers the whole Bucket.

[source,csharp]
----
var upsertResult = await collection.UpsertAsync("doc1", new {Name = "Ted", Age = 31});
var getResult = await collection.GetAsync("doc1");
----

KV Operations are described in detail on the xref:howtos:kv-operations.adoc[KV Operations page].
Now that you know the basics, you may wish to go straight to that page.
//
//
//
//
// -- or first see a complete worked example of using the Couchbase .NET client, our xref:3.0dp1@sample-application.adoc[Travel Sample Application].
//
//

NOTE: The _Developer Preview_ version of the 3.0 .NET Client is entirely asynchronous, following modern .NET development recommendations.
