== Sample App Backend

The https://github.com/couchbaselabs/{travel-sample-git-project}/tree/HEAD/try-cb-dotnet directory contains the `Startup.cs` entrypoint, and various `Models` and `Controllers` which contain functions for handling users, registration, and N1QL queries.

// TODO: we don't use the partial here, because of the location of swagger.json
// in try-cb-dotnet/wwwroot/
== REST API

You can explore the REST API here in read-only mode, or once you are running the application, at the `/apidocs` endpoint.
