= Sample Application



Our Travel Sample Application gives you a quick introduction to using the SDK with Couchbase Server, in particular the powerful N1QL language of our Query service.


== Requirements

* We assume that you have xref:7.0@server:[already installed Couchbase Server 7.0] -- locally, or on a virtual machine.
* Install the SDK -- using the xref:start-using-sdk.adoc[Getting Started instructions].




We will cover the setting up of the app, then using the app.
The data model is covered in a xref:travel-sample-data-model/adoc[separate page],
so as not to interrupt the flow for those in a hurry to get onto working with the code,
and understanding how to use the key HTTP services (KV, Query, Search) with Couchbase Server.
