= Using Couchbase .NET SDK with Visual Studio 2019 or VSCode
:description: The following document explains how to get up in running developing applications with the new Couchbase .NET SDK 3.0.

{description}
The SDK is based off of the .NET Standard 2.0 and supports development targeting various platforms: Windows, Linux and MacOS.


== Using an IDE (Visual Studio 2019 Community)

* Download Visual Studio 2019 for Windows; note that the Community edition is free! https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/
* Click on the Visual Studio Installer and select the following work flows
** .NET desktop development (required for demos)
** ASP.NET and web development (optional)
* Click “Install” and let the installation continue;  I suggest leaving the defaults in place.
* Once installation has been completed, you are ready to start development by creating a new application by including a dependency on the .NET SDK via NuGet or by downloading an example application that already has the dependencies defined.
* Details for installing Visual Studio on other operating systems can be found here:
** MacOS: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=osx
** Linux/DEB: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=linux64_deb
** Linux/RPM: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=linux64_rpm


== Using VSCode

* Visual Studio is a free code editor which run on Windows, Linux and MacOS and can be downloaded here. https://code.visualstudio.com/
* Once downloaded, run the installer VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe; I suggest using the defaults.
* Details for installation of VSCode on each platform can be found here:
** MacOS installation: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac
** Windows 10 installation: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows
** Linux installation: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux


== Installing SDK Core

This doesn’t need to be done if your using the full Visual Studio SDK; however, it is required if you are using VSCode because it is not installed by default:

* For Windows use the installer: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-3.0.100-windows-x64-installer
* For linux select the distro you want to develop on: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/linux-package-manager/rhel/sdk-current
* For MacOs use the installer: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-3.0.100-macos-x64-installer


=== Adding C# Development Support

VSCode is an editor, so in order to have support for various languages like C#, GO, Python, etc. you will need to install a 3rd party extension which supports development in said programming language. For .NET, I suggest using ms-vscode which allows for development in C#, the most commonly used .NET language. Details https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/csharp

* Navigate to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp
* Click on “Install” at the top, left hand side.
* Select “Open Visual Studio Code” this will install ms-vscode into the VSCode editor
* Alternatively, install from VSCode directly:
** Open VSCode
** Select the “Extensions” button on the left hand side or Ctrl + Shift + X
** Type ms-vscode.csharp into the “Search Extensions Marketplace” textbox and hit enter
** Select and install the language extension into the editor.



== Getting started developing with the SDK


=== Using Visual Studio Community

* Open Visual Studio from the start menu
* Click File=>New=>Project from the menu at the top left of Visual Studio
* In the “New Project” dialogue, Installed=>Visual C# from the Menu on the Left
** Select “Console App (.NET Core)”
** Type “CouchbaseExample” in the “Name” textbox
** Leave the “Location” textbox to its default
** Leave the “Solution Name” to its default
** Click “Ok” - a solution and project will be created
* Add the NuGet dependency on “CouchbaseNetClient” to the project:
** Right Click on the “CouchbaseExample” project in the “Solution Explorer” pane of Visual Studio.
** In the Context Menu select “Manage NuGet Packages…”
** Click “Browse” in the NuGet Package Manager
** Type “CouchbaseNetClient” into the search text box making sure “Include Pre-Release” checkbox is selected if you wish to see pre-GA releases
** Select the version to install from the dropdown and the “Install”

You are now ready to start developing your Couchbase application.. 


=== Using VSCode

If you are using VSCode it’s often easier to use both the editor and the Command Line Interface (CIL):

* Open a Command Prompt (Git Bash works good on windows) and make a directory for your project: 
** mkdir “CouchbaseExample”
* Go into the directory: 
** cd CouchbaseExample
* Create the console project: 
** dotnet new console
* Start VSCode to edit the Program.cs file:
** code Program.cs
* Install the CouchbaseNetClient package:
** dotnet add package CouchbaseNetClient           
* Run the application:
** dotnet run

== Running the Example Applications

The following assumes you have installed and configured Visual Studio or VSCode according to the directions above.

Using Visual Studio Community
* Clone the source from github: git clone git@github.com:couchbaselabs/devguide-examples.git
* Open Visual Studio
* Click File=>Open Project/Solution
* Locate the Solution or Project file in the repo you cloned above
* Click “Open” and the project will be opened in the IDE

Using VSCode
* Clone the source from github: git clone git@github.com:couchbaselabs/devguide-examples.git
* Navigate to the directory containing either the solution (.sln) or the project (.csproj) and open it: code DevGuide.sln | code DevGuid.csproj
* VSCode will open the solution.
