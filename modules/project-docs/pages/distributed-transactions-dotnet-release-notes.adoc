== Version 1.1.0 (29 Oct 2021)

This is the first release of Query support in .NET Distributed ACID Transactions.

Along with Query support, this release includes

* Tracing and Telemetry support via IRequestTracer

* Custom Metadata Collection support

* Support for KV operations in any order on the same document.

=== Known Issues

* This release is focused on features and correctness, and has not been optimized for performance issues.
