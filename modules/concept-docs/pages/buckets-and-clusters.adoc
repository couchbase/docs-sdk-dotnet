[abstract]
The Couchbase .NET SDK provides an API for managing a Couchbase cluster programmatically.

include::6.5@sdk:shared:partial$clusters-buckets.adoc[tag=management]

Management operations in the .NET SDK may be performed through several interfaces depending on the object:

== Creating and Removing Buckets

To create or delete a bucket, first get an `IBucketManager` instance from the `Buckets` property on the cluster:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
IBucketManager manager = cluster.Buckets;

// create a bucket
var bucketSettings = new BucketSettings();
bucketSettings.Name = "mynewbucket";
bucketSettings.BucketType = BucketType.Couchbase;
bucketSettings.RamQuotaMB = 100;
await manager.CreateBucketAsync(bucketSettings);

// delete a bucket
await manager.DropBucketAsync("mynewbucket");
----

`IBucketManager` is also used to expose information about an existing bucket (`manager.GetBucketAsync(string)`) or to update an existing bucket (`manager.UpdateBucketAsync(BucketSettings)`).
