= Handling Exceptions and Other Errors with the .NET SDK in Couchbase

[abstract]
This section gives an overview of the kind of error handling a .NET program will want to consider, properties of results, and the kinds of exceptions you should plan to handle.

== How the SDK Handles Errors

The .NET SDK generally handles errors in two ways: either by catching an internally thrown exception and returning it back the application tier as a property of the [.api]`IDocumentResult` or by throwing the exception with the expectation that the application will handle it.
The general rule is if the error is scoped to an operation or query, then it's handled gracefully and returned as part of the response.
If the error is scoped to the client internals and non-recoverable, then the exception is thrown to the application.
An example of an error that is caught and returned as a property of the response would be an `OperationTimeoutException`.
A non-recoverable error such as a `BootstrapException` would be thrown since the client cannot function without successfully bootstrapping to the server.

== Useful Properties of IResult and its Derivatives

The [.api]`Document`, [.api]`Query` (N1QL) and [.api]`View` API methods all return results that inherit from a common interface: IResult.
The IResult interface contains signatures for the following properties:

* *Success*: returns a boolean value indicating whether the overall operation or request was successful or not.
* *Message*: returns an optional message if `Success` was false - this may indicate the reason for the failure.
* *Exception*: if `Success` was false an optional exception if one was generated.

The purpose of these properties is to provide information regarding the operation and if it was a failure, enough information to diagnose or handle the error within the application.
For example, in the event of a failure, the application may decide to rethrow the exception up the stack or perhaps log the error and keep on going.

[source,csharp]
----
var result = bucket.GetDocument("thekey");
if(!result.Success && result.Exception != null){
  throw result.Exception;
}
----

There is also an interface that inherits [.api]`IResult` called [.api]`IResult<T>` which has a Value property of Type "T"; its purpose is for operations that retrieve a document from Couchbase.
A good example would be [.api]`IBucket.GetDocument<T>(string id)` which retrieves a document from Couchbase and casts it to whatever you specify as T (assuming the document is compatible with whatever T is).

As mentioned previously, each SDK has its own [.api]`IResult` specification which extends the definition for its own domain-specific purpose.
Query has an [.api]`IQueryResult<T>` and Views has an [.api]`IViewResult`.
Since both of have IResult in the inheritance chain, they share implementations of the common properties above, plus much more.

For more detail on each specific implementation, look within the section for each of the respective APIs: xref:document-operations.adoc#document-operations-dotnet[Document], xref:n1ql-queries-with-sdk.adoc[Query], xref:full-text-searching-with-sdk.adoc[Full Text Search] and xref:view-queries-with-sdk.adoc#java-views[Views].

== The Exception Types and Their Meanings

As mentioned previously, the .NET SDK differentiates between throwing non-recoverable exceptions and returning recoverable exceptions as part of the IResult.Exception property.
The following table defines each exception type in the SDK and the behavior of the client when it is encountered.

.Overview of .NET SDK Exceptions
[cols="50,121"]
|===
| Name | Description

| BootstrapException
| The client failed to bootstrap for one more reasons.
See Note below.

| AuthenticationException
| The client failed to authenticate - thrown along with BootstrapException.
See Note below.

| ConfigException
| The client could not bootstrap for a given provider type.
Client will generally recover if a Memcached bucket.

| CouchbaseBootstrapException and BootstrapException
| An error occurred while bootstrapping the client on a Couchbase bucket.

| BucketAlreadyOpenException
| An attempt to open a bucket that has already been opened.

| BucketNotFoundException
| A bucket was referenced that does not exist.

| DocumentMutationLostException
| If enhanced durability is enabled, indicates a non-recoverable state when using an overload.

| InitializationException
| A failure occurred during initialization.

| NodeUnavailableException
| Thrown if a node in the cluster is not online to service a pending request.

| ReplicaNotConfiguredException
| Thrown if requested ReplicateTo value exceeds the number of configured replicas on the Server.

| ServiceNotSupportedException
| Thrown if a service (Data, Query, etc) is requested that is not supported or configured on the cluster.

| BufferUnavailableException
| Thrown when an available buffer cannot be obtained from the BufferAllocator.

| ConnectionUnavailableException
| Thrown when an available IConnection cannot be obtained from the IConnectionPool after a number of tries.

| RemoteHostClosedException
| Thrown when the remote host closes a connection.

| RemoteHostTimeoutException
| Thrown when an in-process operation times out.

| IndexAlreadyExistsException
| Thrown when attempting to create an index that already exists.

| IndexDoesNotExistException
| Thrown when an attempt is made to use an index that does not exist.

| PrepareStatementException
| Thrown when the IQueryClient cannot prepare a non-adhoc statement on the server.

| NullConfigException
| Thrown when a node locator can not be found.
This generally indicates a problem in the client internals.

| ServerUnavailableException
| Thrown when the client representation of a remote host cannot be located to fulfill a request.

| UnsupportedAddressFamilyException
| Thrown if an IP cannot be resolved from a domain name.

| System.TimeoutException
| Thrown if a request cannot be fulfilled by the configured timeout.
|===

NOTE: both BootstrapException and AuthenticationException will nearly always be wrapped in a System.AggregateException.

NOTE: not all exceptions are returned back to application or thrown - in many appropriate cases they are handled internally and logged.
This should be considered when using a debugger to break on exceptions.
