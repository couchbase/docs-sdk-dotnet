= Client Settings for the .NET SDK with Couchbase Server
:navtitle: Client Settings

The Couchbase .NET SDK offers a configuration API for customizing bootstrapping, timeouts, reliability and for performance tuning.
You can configure the client programmatically via the [.api]`ClientConfiguration`, [.api]`PoolConfiguration` and [.api]`BucketConfiguration` classes, using XML configuration `App.Config` and or `Web.Config` files or by using JSON config files.

[#dotnet-configurationbasics-settings]
== Configuration Basics

There are three main levels of configuration which correlate to classes or config sections:

. Client level - applies to each and every client instance globally
. Bucket level - applies to a specific bucket and will override any global settings
. Pool level - applies to the connection level of a specific bucket configuration and override any bucket or client level settings if applicable

At each level, there are specific classes or sections for configuring the behavior of the SDK.

NOTE: defaults exists for all properties at each level.
While some, like the bootstrap server list are often overridden since environment is different, others rarely need to be changed from their defaults.
In general, rely on these defaults unless otherwise proven that they do not meet your needs.

At the client level, the [.api]`ClientConfiguration` is the highest level configuration.
Importantly, it contains the list of servers that the client will use to bootstrap against.

[source,csharp]
----
var clientConfig = new ClientConfiguration {
    Servers = new List<Uri> {
        new Uri("http://server1.somedomain.com:8091"),
        new Uri("http://server2.somedomain.com:8091"),
        new Uri("http://server3.somedomain.com:8091")
    }
};
----

The listing above is an example of a client level configuration for bootstrapping against a cluster containing the following nodes: `+http://server1.somedomain.com:8091+`, `+http://server2.somedomain.com:8091+` and `+http://server3.somedomain.com:8091+`.
This will override the default bootstrap host of `+http://localhost:8091+` and the client will use this list to bootstrap the itself to the cluster.

Once you have a config, you'll either pass it into the constructor or the `Cluster` class:

[source,csharp]
----
var cluster = new Cluster(clientConfig);
----

Alternatively, you can initialize the cluster helper:

[source,csharp]
----
ClusterHelper.Initialize(clientConfig);
----

NOTE: calling a Initialize more than once per process or application may cause inconsistent behavior.

A more advanced configuration that uses all three levels might look something like this:

[source,csharp]
----
 var config = new ClientConfiguration {
    BucketConfigs = new Dictionary<string, BucketConfiguration> {
      {"authenticated", new BucketConfiguration {
          PoolConfiguration = new PoolConfiguration {
              MaxSize = 6,
              MinSize = 4,
              SendTimeout = 12000
          },
          DefaultOperationLifespan = 123,
          Password = "password",
          Username = "username",
          BucketName = "authenticated"
      }}
    }
};
----

In this example we are creating a configuration that also overrides the default BucketConfiguration and PoolConfiguration settings.

[#dotnet-appconfig-webconfig-configuration]
== Using an App.Config or Web.Config Configuration

The section above shows how to programmatically configure the client, however in some situations you may want to use an App.Config or Web.Config to configure your client.
For the most part, everything that is available programmatically can be done via the App.Config or Web.Config, for example:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <configSections>
    <sectionGroup name="couchbaseClients">
      <section name="couchbase" type="Couchbase.Configuration.Client.Providers.CouchbaseClientSection, Couchbase.NetClient" />
    </sectionGroup>
  </configSections>
  <couchbaseClients>
    <couchbase username="username" password="password">
     <servers>
        <add uri="http://server1.somedomain.com:8091"></add>
      </servers>
      <buckets>
        <add name="authenticated">
          <connectionPool name="custom" maxSize="6" minSize="4" />
        </add>
        <add name="travel-sample" useSsl="true" />
      </buckets>
    </couchbase>
  </couchbaseClients>
</configuration>
----

This configures two buckets "_beer-sample_" and "_authenticated_" and overrides the "_authenticated_" buckets pool configuration.
To use this configuration, the appropriate constructor is called, passing the section name:

[source,csharp]
----
var cluster = new Cluster("couchbaseClients/couchbase");
----

[#dotnet-json-configuration]
== JSON Configuration

In support of .NET Core, the client can now be configured using JSON config files.

NOTE: JSON configuration is only supported for versions of the SDK 2.3.0 and greater running on .NET Core 1.0 or greater.

[source,csharp]
----
{
  "basic": {
    "username": "username",
    "password": "mypassword",
    "enableConfigHeartbeat": false,
    "servers": [
      "http://server1.somedomain.com:8091/", "http://server2.somedomain.com:8091/"
    ],
    "buckets": [
      {
        "name": "travel-sample"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

Here is an example of opening a cluster using the JSON configuration above:

[source,csharp]
----
var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder();
builder.AddJsonFile("config.json");

var jsonConfiguration = builder.Build();
var definition = new CouchbaseClientDefinition();
jsonConfiguration.GetSection("couchbase:basic").Bind(definition);
var clientConfig = new ClientConfiguration(definition);

var cluster = new Cluster(clientConfig);
var bucket = cluster.OpenBucket("travel-sample");
----

The "travel-sample" bucket is opened using any of the overridden defaults.

== IOService

The IO Service is used to manage the TCP connections used by the SDK for Memcached (K/V) operations.
There are two IO Services available; Multiplexing (MUX) and Pooled.
You can configure the IOService either through the configuration file (app.config, web.config or json settings file) or programmatically using the SDK's ClientConfiguration when initializing the Cluster.

*Shared-Pooled IO Service w/MUX*

As of v2.5.0, the client uses a Shared-Pooled IO Service for K/V along with Multiplexing (MUX) by default.
A shared pool allows multiple threads to use a connection at the same time and each thread is assigned a connection from the pool in a round-robin fashion.
This gives the best performance and the benefits of both Multiplexing IO Service and Pooled IO Service.
This is the reccomended configuration and is the default from v2.5.0 on - there is no need for additional configuration to use it.

*Multiplexing IO Service (Obsolete)*

Multiplexing is when a single TCP connection is used by multiple threads to send and receive requests simultaneously.
The benefit's are improved throughput with less strain on the OS resources and importantly, a reduction on the number of TCP connections between the client and the server.
The Multiplexing IO Service is the default IO Service if no custom configuration is provided.

*Pooled IO Service (SSL only)*

Pooled is when the SDK maintains a pool of TCP sockets and each thread uses a single socket at one time for Memcached K/V operations (Get, Insert, Remove, etc.).
The connection pool limit is capped by the MinSize and MaxSize configuration settings; if MaxSize has been reached, the SDK would wait for a connection to become available or it would return an OperationTimeout response.

*Configuring the IO Service*

NOTE: The default IO Service as of v2.6.0 is Shared-Pooled IO Service w/MUX and is the reccomended IO Service to use for non-SSL/TLS.
We do not recommend using any of the other IO services or changing the default settings for IO Services as described below.

To configure the IO Service in your configuration file you would set the connectionPool element and ioService elements.
An example of setting the configuration file to use PooledIOService would look like this:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
   <configSections>
      <sectionGroup name="couchbaseClients">
         <section name="couchbase" type="Couchbase.Configuration.Client.Providers.CouchbaseClientSection, Couchbase.NetClient" />
      </sectionGroup>
   </configSections>
   <couchbaseClients>
      <couchbase enableConfigHeartBeat="false">
         <servers>
            <add uri="http://127.0.0.1:8091" />
         </servers>
         <connectionPool name="custom" type="Couchbase.IO.ConnectionPool`1[Couchbase.IO.Connection], Couchbase.NetClient" />
         <ioService name="multiplexio" type="Couchbase.IO.Services.PooledIOService, Couchbase.NetClient" />
      </couchbase>
   </couchbaseClients>
</configuration>
----

To configure the IO Service programmatically you would use the ClientConfiguration and setting the IOServiceCreator properties.
An example that configures the Multiplexing IO Service would look like this:

[source,csharp]
----
var config = new ClientConfiguration
{
    Servers = newList<Uri>
    {
        new Uri(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["bootstrapUrl"])
    }
};
config = ConnectionPoolFactory.GetFactory<ConnectionPool<MultiplexingConnection>>();
config.IOServiceCreator = IOServiceFactory.GetFactory<MultiplexingIOService>();
ClusterHelper.Initialize(config);
----

*Caveats*

A couple of caveats are in order:

* SSL is not yet supported for MUX (https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/NCBC-1056[JIRA ticket^])
* MUX has no effect on Views, N1QL or Full Text Search queries
* Shared-Pooled IO Service w/MUX currently ignores the MinSize and creates the MaxSize of connections configured.
This is a known issue/limitation and can be tracked by the following Jira ticket: https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/NCBC-1534[^]
