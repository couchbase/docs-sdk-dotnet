= Compression
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
In response to increasing volumes of data being sent over the wire, Couchbase Data Platform now provides data compression between the SDK and Couchbase Server.
This is not available in .NET, as the platform does not support Snappy compression.

Couchbase Server (in the Enterprise Edition) stores documents in compressed form, using Snappy Compression.
As the Snappy compression library is not available for .NET, the server will automatically uncompress the document before sending it to the .NET client.
