= Health Check
:description: In today's distributed and virtual environments, users will often not have full administrative control over their whole network.

{description}
Health Check introduces _Ping_ to check nodes are still healthy, and to force idle connections to be kept alive in environments with eager shutdowns of unused resources.
_Diagnostics_ requests a report from a node, giving instant health check information.


Diagnosing problems in distributed environments is far from easy, so Couchbase provides a _Health Check API_ with `Ping()` for active monitoring. ans `Diagnostics()` for a look at what the client believes is the current state of the cluster. 
More extensive discussion of the uses of Health Check can be found in the xref:concept-docs:health-check.adoc[Health Check Concept Guide].


== Ping

At its simplest, `ping` provides information about the current state of the connections in the Couchbase Cluster, by actively polling:

[source,csharp]
----
async Task PrintPingAsync(IBucket bucket)
{
    var pingResult =  await bucket.PingAsync();
    Console.WriteLine(pingResult.ToString());
}
----

Which, for a single-node test cluster, will return a payload similar to this:

[source,json]
----

	"version": 1,
	"config_rev": 814,

	}
}

//**Removing below because of bug NCBC-3246**
//If you only wish to know if there's a connection that's up, filter out the rest of the information:

// 2.x example
//[source,java]
//----
//boolean allEndpointsConnected(DiagnosticsReport report) {
//for (EndpointHealth endpoint : report.endpoints()) {
//  if (endpoint.state() != LifecycleState.CONNECTED) {
//       return false;
//   }
// return true;
//}
//----

== Diagnostics

`Diagnostics` returns a list of the nodes that the SDK currently has (or had) a connection to, and the current status of the connection.
However this call _does not_ actively poll the nodes, reporting instead the state the last time it tried to access each node.
If you want the _current_ status, then use xref:#ping[Ping].

[source,csharp]
----
async Task PrintDiagnosticsAsync(IBucket bucket)
{
    var diagnosticsResult = await cluster.DiagnosticsAsync();
    Console.WriteLine(diagnosticsResult.ToString());
}
----

Which will print something like this:

[source,json]
----
{
	"id": "d1eda895-ace4-4151-b77f-75b93e01eb60",
	"version": 1,

		}],
		"view": [{

		}],
		"n1ql": [{

	}
}
