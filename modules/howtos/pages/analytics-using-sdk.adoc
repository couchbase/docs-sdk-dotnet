For complex and long-running queries, involving large ad hoc join, set, aggregation, and grouping operations, Couchbase Data Platform offers the xref:7.1@server:analytics:introduction.adoc[Couchbase Analytics Service (CBAS)].
This is the analytic counterpart to our xref:n1ql-queries-with-sdk.adoc[operational data focussed Query Service].
The analytics service is available in Couchbase Data Platform 6.0 and later (developer preview in 5.5).


== Getting Started

After familiarizing yourself with our xref:7.1@server:analytics:primer-beer.adoc[introductory primer],
in particular creating a dataset and linking it to a bucket to shadow the operational data,
try Couchbase Analytics using the .NET SDK.
Intentionally, the API for analytics is very similar to that of the query service.
In .NET SDK 2.6 and 2.7, Analytics was only available on the `Bucket` object;
in .NET SDK 3.x, Analytics queries are submitted using the Cluster reference, not a Bucket or Collection:

[source,csharp]
----
var result = await cluster.AnalyticsQueryAsync<dynamic>("SELECT \"hello\" as greeting;");

foreach (var row in result.Rows)
{
    Console.WriteLine(row.greeting);
}
----


== Queries

A query can either be `simple` or be `parameterized`. If parameters are used, they can either be `positional` or `named`.
Here is one example of each:

[source,csharp]
----
var result = await cluster.AnalyticsQueryAsync<dynamic>("select airportname, country from airports where country = 'France';");
----

The query may be performed with positional parameters:

[source,csharp]
----
var result = await cluster.AnalyticsQueryAsync<dynamic>("select airportname, country from airports where country = ?;")
    .AddPositionalParameter("France");
----

Alternatively, the query may be performed with named parameters:

[source,csharp]
----
var result = await cluster.AnalyticsQueryAsync<dynamic>("select airportname, country from airports where country = $country;")
    .AddNamedParameter("country", "France");
----

NOTE: As timeouts are propagated to the server by the client, a timeout set on the client side may be used to stop the processing of a request, in order to save system resources.
See example in the next section.


== Fluent API

Additional parameters may be sent as part of the query, using the fluent API.
There are currently three parameters:

* *Client Context ID*, sets a context ID that is returned back as part of the result.
Uses the `ClientContextId(String)` builder; default is a random UUID
* *Server Side Timeout*, customizes the timeout sent to the server.
Does not usually have to be set, as the client sets it based on the timeout on the operation.
Uses the `Timeout(TimeSpan)` builder, and defaults to the Analytics timeout set on the client (75s).
This can be adjusted at the xref:ref:client-settings.adoc#timeout-options[cluster global config level].
* *Priority*, set if the request should have priority over others.
The `Priority(boolean)` builder defaults to `false`.


Here, we give the request priority over others, and set a custom, server-side timeout value:

[source,csharp]
----
var result = await cluster.AnalyticsQueryAsync<dynamic>("select airportname, country from airports where country = 'France';",
    options =>
    {
        options.WithPriority(true);
        options.WithTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(100));
    }
);
----


== Handling the Response

After checking that `QueryStatus` is success, we iterate over the rows.
These rows may contain various sorts of data and metadata,
depending upon the nature of the query,
as you will have seen when working through our xref:7.1@server:analytics:primer-beer.adoc[introductory primer].

[source,csharp]
----
try
{
    var result = await cluster.AnalyticsQueryAsync<dynamic>("SELECT \"hello\" as greeting;");

    if (result.Rows.Any()) // check there are results
    {
        foreach (var row in result.Rows)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Greeting: {row.greeting}");
        }
    }
}
catch (AnalyticsException exception)
{
    foreach (var error in exception.Errors)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($”Error: {error.Message}”);
    }
}
----

Check the xref:[Errors] list for possible values to be returned in the `List<Error>`, should `QueryStatus` return as `Errors`.

// Move these to Error reference doc?
Common errors are listed in our xref:ref:error-codes.adoc#analytics-errors[Errors Reference doc], with exceptions caused by resource unavailability (such as timeouts and _Operation cannot be performed during rebalance_ messages) leading to an xref:howtos:error-handling.adoc#retry[automatic retry] by the SDK.

////
Moving these to error reference doc
----
21002: Request timed out and will be cancelled
23000: Analytics Service is temporarily unavailable
23003: Operation cannot be performed during rebalance
23007: Job queue is full with [string] jobs
----
////

=== MetaData

The `Metrics` object contains useful metadata, such as `ElapsedTime`, and `ResultCount`.
Here is a snippet using several items of metadata

[source,csharp]
----
var result = await cluster.AnalyticsQueryAsync<dynamic>("SELECT \"hello\" as greeting;");

Console.WriteLine($”Elapsed time: {result.MetaData.Metrics.ElapsedTime}”);
Console.WriteLine($”Execution time: {result.MetaData.Metrics.ExecutionTime}”);
Console.WriteLine($”Result count: {result.MetaData.Metrics.ResultCount}”);
Console.WriteLine($”Error count: {result.MetaData.Metrics.ErrorCount}”);
----

For a listing of available `Metrics` in `MetaData`, see the xref:concept-docs:analytics-for-sdk-users.adoc[Understanding Analytics] SDK doc.


== Advanced Analytics Topics

From Couchbase Data Platform 6.5, _Deferred Queries_ and _KV Ingestion_ are added to CBAS.

////
// NB: per SDK team, this was removed from SDK, is not in RFC
//     per Analytics team, is not exposed in Analytics service (though the feature does exist in open source AsteriskDB.)
=== Deferred queries

Deferred queries enable the decoupling of the long-running query execution from the result.
A handle is created, allowing the in-progress query to be checked, and the result returned later, without locking up resources or network bandwidth.

WARNING: In Couchbase Data Platform 6.5, Deferred Queries is in _Developer Preview_.
From .NET SDK 3.1, Deferred Queries have an Interface Level of xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#interface-stability[Volatile].

Deferred querying is enabled with `options.WithDeferred(true)`,
and by checking `QueryStatus` as appropriate to the task at hand.

[source,csharp]
----
// execute deferred query
var result = await _fixture.Cluster.AnalyticsQueryAsync<TestRequest>(
    statement,
    options => options.WithDeferred(true)
);

// periodically check for results
while (true)
{
    await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));

    // use result object to query for current status
    var status = await result.Handle.GetStatusAsync();
    switch (status)
    {
        case QueryStatus.Running: // still waiting
            continue;
        case QueryStatus.Completed: // results ready to be queried
        case QueryStatus.Success:

            // get result rows
            foreach (var row in result.Handle.GetRows())
            {

            }

            break;
        default: // something went wrong ..
            break;
    }
}
----

A Deferred query handle can be stored and then recreated,
to query a result at a later time or in another process.

[source,csharp]
----
// get serialized (JSON) representation of query
var json = _fixture.Cluster.ExportDeferredAnalyticsQueryHandle(result.Handle);

// repopulate query using serialized query
var handle = _fixture.Cluster.ImportDeferredAnalyticsQueryHandle<dynamic>(json);
----
////

=== KV ingest

You can ingest the results of an Analytics query directly back into a given collection.
This then allows the results themselves to be queried in turn.

NOTE: From .NET SDK 3.1, KV Ingest has an Interface Level of xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#interface-stability[Uncommited].

[source,csharp]
----
await cluster.IngestAsync<dynamic>(
    statement,
    collection,
    options =>
    {
        options.WithTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(75));
        options.WithExpiration(TimeSpan.FromDays(1));
    }
);
----

== Scoped Queries on Named Collections

In addition to creating a dataset with a WHERE clause to filter the results to documents with certain characteristics, from SDK 3.1 you can now create a dataset against a named collection, for example:

[source,n1ql]
----
ALTER COLLECTION `travel-sample`.inventory.airport ENABLE ANALYTICS;

-- NB: this is more or less equivalent to:
CREATE DATAVERSE `travel-sample`.inventory;
CREATE DATASET `travel-sample`.inventory.airport ON `travel-sample`.inventory.airport;
----

We can then query the Dataset as normal, using the fully qualified keyspace:

[source,csharp]
----
include::devguide:example$dotnet/Analytics.cs[tag=handle-collection,indent=0]
----

////
Note that using the `CREATE DATASET` syntax we could choose any Dataset name in any Dataverse, including the default.
However the SDK supports this standard convention, allowing us to query from the Scope object:


[source,csharp]
----
include::devguide:example$dotnet/Analytics.cs[tag=handle-scope,indent=0]
----
