[abstract]
As well as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Couchbase offers connection with Certificate Authentication, and works transparently with LDAP.


Our xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Getting Started] guide covered the basics for authorizing against a Couchbase cluster, but you may need to use alternative authentication methods such as Certification.


== RBAC

Our xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Getting Started] guide introduced basic authentication against a Couchbase cluster:

== Authenticating a .NET Client by Certificate

For sample procedures whereby certificates can be generated and deployed, see xref:7.0@server:manage:manage-security/manage-certificates.adoc[Manage Certificates].

The rest of this document assumes that the processes there, or something similar, have been followed.
That is, a cluster certificate has been created and installed on the server, a client certificate has been created, and it is stored in a keystore along with the cluster's certificate.
