= N1QL Queries from the SDK

:page-aliases: n1ql-query



Our query service uses N1QL, which will be fairly familiar to anyone who's used any dialect of SQL.
xref:#additional-resources[Further resources] for learning about N1QL are listed at the bottom of the page.
You may wish to  //// link
or just dive in with a query against our travel sample data set.
In this case, the one thing that you need to know is that in order to make a bucket queryable, it must have at least one index defined.
You can define a _primary_ index on a bucket. 
When a primary index is defined you can issue non-covered queries on the bucket as well.

Use
xref:6.5@server::tools/cbq-shell.html
our interactive Query shell.
Open it, and enter the following:

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON `users`
----

NOTE: The default installation places cbq in `/opt/couchbase/bin/` on Linux, `/Applications/Couchbase Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin/cbq` on OS X, and `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\cbq.exe` on Microsoft Windows


== Queries & Placeholders

To issue N1QL queries from the .NET SDK, you should create a `QueryRequest` object

//// ...

Placeholders allow you to specify variable constraints for an otherwise constant query. 
There are two variants of placeholders: postional and named parameters. 
Positional parameters use an ordinal placeholder for substitution and named parameters use variables. 
A named or positional parameter is a placeholder for a value in the WHERE, LIMIT or OFFSET clause of a query. 
Note that both parameters and options are optional.

Positional parameter example:
[source,csharp]
----
var parameters = new QueryParameters()
    .Add("User");
var options = new QueryOptions();
var result = await collection.Query<dynamic>(
    "SELECT x.* FROM `default` WHERE x.Type=$1",
    parameters,
    options
);
----

Named parameter example:
[source,csharp]
----
var parameters = new QueryParameters()
    .Add("type", "User");
var options = new QueryOptions();

var result = await collection.Query<dynamic>(
    "SELECT x.* FROM `default` WHERE x.Type=$type",
    parameters,
    options
);
----

== QueryResult


/// errors returned by the N1QL service during execution are returned in the QueryResult.Errors property, rather than by throwing exceptions. Here is a list of important QueryResult properties:



== Building Statements with LINQ (Language Integrated Query)





== Querying Asynchronously




== Scan Consistency




== Streaming Large Result Sets




== Streaming rows
