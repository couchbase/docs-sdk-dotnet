[abstract]
All async



By preference, the .NET API uses the _Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)_, with `await`, and synchronous programming is undesirable in the vast majority of use-cases.


// work with Jeff on a good illustrative example


// rx.net for reactive -- add section later, when appears on Couchbaselabs?



== Batching

// await Task.WhenAll()
