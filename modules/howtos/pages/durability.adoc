== Transactions

Couchbase Data Platform 6.5 also sees a _*Beta*_ release of our _Multi-Document Atomicity_ feature, _a.k.a._ _Transactions_.
Although atomicity guarantees occur a performance overhead, there are some circumstances where a guarantee of a document change not going astray is the most important aspect of the operation.
