3.0 with <=6.0

xref: /// old docs[more in-depth discussion can be found in the old docs].


== Strong Consistency

With the release of Couchbase Data Platform 6.5, we introduce Synchronous Replication. 


////
== Transactions

Couchbase Data Platform 6.5 also sees a _*Beta*_ release of our _Multi-Document Atomicity_ feature, _a.k.a._ _Transactions_.
Although atomicity guarantees occur a performance overhead, there are some circumstances where a guarantee of a document change not going astray is the most important aspect of the operation.
