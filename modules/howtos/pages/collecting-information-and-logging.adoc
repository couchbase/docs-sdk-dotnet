= Collecting Information and Logging in the .NET SDK with Couchbase Server

[abstract]
Couchbase .NET SDK3 relies on the Microsoft.Extensions.Logging API and specifically on the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILoggerFactory` interface to support a wide variety of compatible 3rd party logging implementations such as Serilog, NLog, and others. 
Further details can be found in the Microsoft documentation for https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging[Logging^] and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging-providers[Logging Providers^].


== Couchbase .NET SDK Logging Basics

The Couchbase .NET SDK allows for any logging provider to be plugged in as long as it implements the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILoggerFactory` interface. 
It does this via Method injection in the `ClusterOptions` class which is passed to the Cluster object when `Cluster.ConnectAsync` is called. 

Note: In most of the examples below, the default .NET logging providers are used,  -- otherwise, we are using the https://github.com/serilog/serilog-extensions-logging-file[Serilog one-liner^] logging https://www.nuget.org/packages/Serilog.Extensions.Logging.File/[package^]:

[source]
----
Install-Package Serilog.Extensions.Logging.File -Version 2.0.0
----

[source]
----
<PackageReference Include="Serilog.Extensions.Logging.File" Version="2.0.0" />
----


== Logging in a .NET Core Non-Host Application

If you are not using a `Host`, and not using Dependency Injection, you can still configure a `ILoggerFactory` using the SDK. 
In this example we have a dependency on Serilog single file logging:

[source]
----
Install-Package Serilog.Extensions.Logging.File -Version 2.0.0
----

We are using a .NET Core Console Application, and simply instantiate the `ILoggingProvider`:

[source,csharp]
----
include::example$Couchbase.Examples.Logging.NonHost/Program.cs[tag=non-host,indent=0]
----

We then call `ClusterOptions.WithLogging` and pass in the `ILoggerProvider` that we instatiated, and connect to the `Cluster` as usual.


== Logging in applications targeting the .NET Core Generic Host

For .NET Core 3.0 and greater applications, the Generic https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/generic-host[Host^] is used to configure logging.

[source,csharp]
----
include::example$Couchbase.Examples.Logging.GenericHost/Program.cs[tag=generic-host,indent=0]
----

In the example above, `Host.ConfigureLogging` is called in the `CreateHostBuilder` method where we clear any previously registered logging providers (.NET registers a couple by default). 
Then `AddConsole` is called to configure logging to the console which will be visible when you run the application.

Note that because we are using https://www.nuget.org/packages/Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection/[Couchbase Dependency Injection^], we do not have to explicitly call `ClusterOptions.WithLogging(ILoggerFactory factory)` and pass in the `ILoggerFactory`; 
this will be handled by https://www.nuget.org/packages/Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection/[Couchbase Dependency Injection^] internally.


== Logging in applications targeting the .NET Full Framework

Targeting logging in .NET Full applications is a bit more challenging in that there is no DI container, thus the standard way of injecting the logging dependencies won't work. 
Furthermore, since there is no support for the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` interfaces, we'll need to create our own wrappers. 
One for a Log4Net `ILogger` implementation:

[source,csharp]
----
include::example$Couchbase.Examples.Logging.FullFramework/Log4NetLogger.cs[tag=full-log4netlogger,indent=0]
----

Then a `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILoggingProvider` implementation:

[source,csharp]
----
include::example$Couchbase.Examples.Logging.FullFramework/Log4NetProvider.cs[tag=full-log4netprovider,indent=0]
----

And some extensions to make it easier to use:

[source,csharp]
----
include::example$Couchbase.Examples.Logging.FullFramework/Log4NetExtensions.cs[tag=full-log4netextensions,indent=0]
----

Finally, we put it all together:

[source,csharp]
----
include::example$Couchbase.Examples.Logging.FullFramework/Program.cs[tag=full-full-framework,indent=0]
----

Note that we suggest .NET Core or .NET 5.0 over using SDK3 in .NET Full Framework apps, as the integration is much more difficult.
