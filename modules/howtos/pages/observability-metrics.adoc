= Metrics Reporting
:description: Individual request tracing presents a very specific (though isolated) view of the system.

{description}
In addition, it also makes sense to capture information that aggregates request data (i.e. requests per second),
but also data which is not tied to a specific request at all (i.e. resource utilization).

The deployment situation itself is similar to the request tracer: either applications already have a metrics infrastructure in place or they donâ€™t. 
The difference is that exposing some kind of metrics is much more common than request based tracing, 
because most production deployments at least monitor CPU and memory usage (e.g. through JMX).

Metrics broadly fall into the following categories:

* Request/Response Metrics (such as requests per second).
* SDK Metrics (such as how many open collections, various queue lengths).
* System Metrics (such as cpu usage or garbage collection performance).

Right now only the first category is implemented by the SDK, more are planned.

== The Default LoggingMeter

The default implementation aggregates and logs request and response metrics.

By default the metrics will be emitted every 10 minutes, but you can customize the emit interval as well:

[source,csharp]
----
clusterOptions.WithLoggingMeterOptions(
    new LoggingMeterOptions()
    .Enabled(true)
    .EmitInterval(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)));
----

Once enabled, there is no further configuration needed. The `LoggingMeter` will emit the collected request statistics every interval.
A possible report looks like this (prettified for better readability):

[source,json]
----
{
   "meta":{
      "emit_interval_s":10
   },
   "query":{
      "127.0.0.1":{
         "total_count":9411,
         "percentiles_us":{
            "50.0":544.767,
            "90.0":905.215,
            "99.0":1589.247,
            "99.9":4095.999,
            "100.0":100663.295
         }
      }
   },
   "kv":{
      "127.0.0.1":{
         "total_count":9414,
         "percentiles_us":{
            "50.0":155.647,
            "90.0":274.431,
            "99.0":544.767,
            "99.9":1867.775,
            "100.0":574619.647
         }
      }
   }
}
----

Each report contains one object for each service that got used and is further separated on a per-node basis so they can be analyzed in isolation.

For each service / host combination, a total amount of recorded requests is reported, as well as percentiles from a histogram in microseconds. 
The meta section on top contains information such as the emit interval in seconds so tooling can later calculate numbers like requests per second.

The `LoggingMeter` can be configured on the environment as shown above.
The following table shows the currently available properties:

.LoggingMeterConfig Properties
[options="header"]
|====
| Property       | Default | Description
| `enabled`   | false | If the `LoggingMeter` should be enabled.
| `emitInterval` | 600 seconds | The interval where found orphans are emitted.
|====


== OpenTelemetry Integration

The SDK supports plugging in any `OpenTelemetry` metrics consumer instead of using the default `LoggingMeter`.
To do this, first you need to add an additional dependency to your application:

[source,xml]
----
<PackageReference Include="Couchbase.Extensions.OpenTelemetry" Version="3.3.2" />
----

In addition, you need to add the OpenTelemetry exporter of your choice. 
As an example this could be the Console exporter:

[source,xml]
----
<PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console" Version="1.3.0" />
----

Next, you need to initialize your OpenTelemetry `Meter` and associate the Couchbase metrics with the exporter. Again, the following example uses Console:

[source,csharp]
----
 using var meterProvider = Sdk.CreateMeterProviderBuilder()
    .AddCouchbaseInstrumentation()
    .AddConsoleExporter()
    .Build();
----

Once your meter is initialized, the Couchbase `Cluster` and `Bucket` need to be injected via configuration:

[source,csharp]
----
 IHost host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
    .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>
    {
        services.AddCouchbase(opts =>
        {
            opts.WithConnectionString("couchbase://localhost");
            opts.WithCredentials("Administrator", "password");
        });
        services.AddCouchbaseBucket<INamedBucketProvider>("default");
        services.AddHostedService<Worker>();
    }).ConfigureAppConfiguration(app => {})
    .Build();

host.Run();
----

The application being metered is a simple `IHostedWorker` class:

[source,csharp]
----
public class Worker : IHostedService {
    public Worker(INamedBucketProvider provider) {
        Provider = provider;
    }

    public INamedBucketProvider Provider { get; }

    public async Task StartAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken) {
        var bucket = await Provider.GetBucketAsync();
        while (true)
        {
            var upsert = await bucket.DefaultCollection().UpsertAsync<dynamic>("key1", new { Name = "key1" });
            await Task.Delay(400);
        }
    }

    public Task StopAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken) {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
----

At this point the SDK is hooked up with the OpenTelemetry metrics and will emit them to the exporter. 
The specific output format is still evolving, but look out for metrics with the `cb.` prefix: `cb.requests` and `cb.responses`. 
The `cb.requests` is a counter while the `cb.responses` is a `ValueRecorder` which also collects latency information for each request. 
Each metric contains tags that allow you to group them in different ways, including the service type (e.g. `query`) or the server hostname.

== Additional Couchbase .NET Event Counters

The Couchbase .NET SDK offers https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/metrics[metrics] to support instrumenting your application.
These metrics may be https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/metrics-collection[collected] in a variety of ways such as the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-counters[dotnet-counters tool], the new https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-monitor-in-net-6/[dotnet-monitor tool], or instrumented directly in code using the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.metrics.meterlistener?view=net-6.0[MeterListener class].

=== Meter Types

==== Gauge

Gauges show a snapshot of the value at a given point in time.

==== Counter

Counters return a total that continues to increase over time. These are useful for calculating the rate of events over some period of time.

==== Histogram

Typically used for measuring durations, this meter tracks distributions such as averages and 95th percentile.

=== Meters

The following meters are exposed under the `CouchbaseNetClient` meter name.

Output measurements to these meters may be tagged with additional data.
