Sometimes more logic is needed when performing updates, for example, if a property is mutually exclusive with another property; only one or the other can exist, but not both.

(For the .NET equivalent, refer to the https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-net-client/html/T_Couchbase_KeyValue_GetAndLockOptions.htm[API documentation].)

The handler will unlock the item either via an explicit unlock operation ([.api]`unlock`) or implicitly via modifying the item with the correct CAS.

If the item has already been locked, the server will respond with CasMismatch which means that the operation could not be executed temporarily, but may succeed later on.
